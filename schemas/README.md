# Public configuration schemas

Phase 0 documentation bootstrap is complete at baseline commit
`79cc9d77fd48410f37645afdb429a7cd2e34a0bd`. Phase 1: Schemas and
Models is current, but Phase 1 implementation has not yet begun. The repository
remains pre-operational, and this directory contains no Schema implementation.
The v1alpha1 Schema contract design is recorded in
[the Schema contract design](../docs/schema-contract-v1alpha1.md).
Independent design audit and `integration-control` design approval are
complete. The recorded decision is
`APPROVE SCHEMA DESIGN FOR INTEGRATION — TOOLCHAIN GATE REMAINS`. PR #1 is
open and unmerged, so the design is not yet integrated into `main`. This
material PR-review repair requires fresh independent re-audit and
`integration-control` confirmation before integration. The exact 11-resource
UUID-URN catalog remains `reserved-unpublished`; it reserves identifiers but
does not publish or implement Schema resources, and no Schema artifact exists.

The initial public configuration API version is `contextctl.dev/v1alpha1`.
Future Schema definitions will live under `schemas/v1alpha1/`. Configuration
API versions MUST evolve independently of package release versions, which will
use Semantic Versioning.

No Schema implementation may begin until `integration-control` has approved
the validator/toolchain, packaging, dependency lock, provenance, licensing,
security, and release gate. The first Schema artifact then requires a fresh,
separately authorized `schema-contracts` task in this dedicated role worktree.
Model-worktree creation and model implementation remain prohibited until the
approved Schema baseline is committed, reviewed, and integrated into `main`.

## Phase 1 ownership and boundary

`schema-contracts` owns `schemas/v1alpha1/**`, shared Schema definitions,
strict object envelopes, Schema-expressible structural constraints,
unknown-field rejection, types, formats, enums, required fields, local
structural invariants, conspicuously synthetic positive and negative Schema
fixtures, Schema validation and contract tests, and documentation changes
directly required to describe the proposed Schema contract through approval.

Within the Phase 1 boundary established by ADR 0005, Schema work MAY
cover JSON Schema structural validation; supported API-version checks; field
type, format, enum, range, and required-property validation; object-local
invariants; and Schema-expressible portions of closed-bundle ID uniqueness,
reference shape, reference existence, and static restriction-shape checks. The
role MAY document
semantic invariants that later phases must enforce, but it MUST NOT implement
Python models, decoding, canonical serialization, deterministic task
resolution, `RoutingPolicy` execution, live Git inspection, runtime leases,
`TaskContract` issuance, receipt generation, a CLI, adapters, or operational
enforcement.

The Schema baseline MUST be designed, independently audited, approved through
`integration-control`, committed, reviewed, and integrated into `main` before a
distinct `model-implementation` worktree is created or bound from that updated
`main`. Schema and model implementation tasks MUST NOT share a worktree.

## Object families and later validation

Schema definitions for all seven kinds—`Project`, `Domain`, `WorktreeRole`,
`HostOverlay`, `RoutingPolicy`, `TaskContract`, and `ExecutionReceipt`—MAY later
live here. Schema location does not determine concrete-instance trust or
storage. Concrete `Project`, `Domain`, `WorktreeRole`, and `RoutingPolicy`
instances are portable customer governance; concrete `HostOverlay` instances
are host-local input; and concrete `TaskContract` and `ExecutionReceipt`
instances are runtime artifacts. Host-local and runtime instances MUST remain
outside the target worktree, and generated receipts MUST never become portable
governance.

Phase 1 static configuration and model integrity validation MUST remain
separate from operational semantic execution. Matching task intent to a
`Project`, resolving a task's `Domain` set, evaluating `RoutingPolicy`, selecting
a role, and deciding split versus deny are Phase 2. Live Git and worktree
inspection, runtime coordination, and leases are Phase 3. Trusted runtime
contract issuance or provenance validation, scope authorization and
verification, terminalization, and receipt generation are Phase 4. CLI and
adapter implementation remain Phases 5 and 6, respectively.

Machine-readable structured customer governance will be authoritative for the
future operational path. Markdown MAY explain or mirror that configuration,
but it MUST NOT independently grant authority. See the
[configuration model](../docs/configuration-model.md) for the planned objects
and trust boundaries.
